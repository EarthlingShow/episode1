# Elijah playing in the Sandbox

Tonight, my two year old son Elijah proved once again that he’s paying attention when he began making “vroom, vroom” sounds when he was playing with his sandbox vehicles tonight. I caught him on video:

I felt a bit of pride because I kind of taught him to do that a few weeks ago. I was making the same sort of sounds when I demonstrated that the dirt-scooper-vehicle could be used to fill the dump truck up with sand. And then, the dump truck would drive two feet away and then dump the sand out.

The video above is a glimpse at another of Elijah’s favorite things to do, which is to dump water into the sandbox. Unfortunately, I have to take responsibility for this, too. A few weeks ago, the sand was really dry, so I walked over, filled Elijah’s little red bucket up with water, and dumped it into a spot so that some of the sand would be moist enough to clump together. I didn’t realize that he was going to take such a liking to the actual process of getting the water, carrying it, and dumping it out.

My favorite parts are watching him very gingerly carry the bucket across the yard, and then of course dump the water into the sand victoriously.
